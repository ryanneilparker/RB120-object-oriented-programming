=begin
Create a superclass called Vehicle for your MyCar class to inherit from and move the behavior that isn't specific to the MyCar class to the superclass. 
Create a constant in your MyCar class that stores information about the vehicle that makes it different from other types of Vehicles.

Then create a new class called MyTruck that inherits from your superclass that also has a constant defined that separates it from the MyCar class in some way.

Add a class variable to your superclass that can keep track of the number of objects created that inherit from the superclass. 
Create a method to print out the value of this class variable as well.

Create a module that you can mix in to ONE of your subclasses that describes a behavior unique to that subclass.

Print to the screen your method lookup for the classes that you have created.

Move all of the methods from the MyCar class that also pertain to the MyTruck class into the Vehicle class.
 Make sure that all of your previous method calls are working when you are finished.
